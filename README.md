# Before the Beginning

A few days ago, my supervisor asked me to write a document for some fellow grad students on an introduction of LLMs (Large Language Models) and how to simply apply them into researches. At first, I decided to delay without any interest and motivation. However, one day I suddenly thought that, since I believe actually LLMs could be considered as a process pipeline for almost any task in any field**,** maybe it is a better idea to write such an article for anyone who is major in another field without much knowledge on LLMs. It is indeed the real motivation for me. Thus, the title of the passage is **LLM4PP** (**L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels **for** a **P**rocess **P**ipeline ). So, let's start...













Please cite the article if your work is motivated from it.
